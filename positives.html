          <h2>Advantages of Technology in the Classroom:</h2>
  
          <h3>Increased Student Engagement</h3>
          <p>Students that use technology in the classroom may become more engaged. When schools implement a 1:1 system (one device for each student), students gain since technology is more smoothly integrated into the curriculum. Furthermore, gamified learning makes education enjoyable and engaging as students earn badges and progress through competencies (Gcu, 2020).</p>

          <h3>Collaboration</h3>
          <p>Technology facilitates collaboration and allows students to save their work. Traditionally, when students collaborated, they would make posters or notes about their work together. However, technology allows students to create digital collections of research and ideas. They can sketch and write in the same program, creating documents and projects that are fully collaborative (Gcu, 2020).</p>

          <h3>Inclusion</h3>
          <p>Technology can enable some students to participate in the classroom in ways they never have before. Many students in special education can benefit from technology that allows them to write, spell, read and perform mathematical computation (Gcu, 2020).</p>

          <h3>Creativity</h3>
          <p>There is a limitless amount of content available online. Students who are interested in learning arts, music, videos, and nearly anything else can find a variety of materials. Any creative endeavor that interests a student can be supported by technology. Technology can encourage creativity rather than restrict it when students are given a choice in what they create (Gcu, 2020).</p>

          <h3>Prepares Students for the Future</h3>
          <p>According to a CompTIA analysis, nine out of ten students believe that using technology in the classroom will better prepare them for the digital future. Teaching students' skills like PowerPoint can prepare students for success. Introducing instructional technology into the classroom at an early age can help set up students for future digital demands (Walden University, 2023).</p>

          <h3>Connects Students with Their Teachers</h3>
          <p>Technology can help teachers build a better relationship with their students and colleagues. For example, 84% of teachers report saying they use the internet at least once weekly to discover engaging content for their students. Integrating technology into your lesson planning and using it to expand your own knowledge of the subject can make a major difference in the classroom. Technology will undoubtedly continue to evolve, and it is important you adjust your classroom style to align with the latest advancements (Walden University, 2023).</p>
