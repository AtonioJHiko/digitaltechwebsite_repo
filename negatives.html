    <h2>Disadvantages of Technology in the Classroom:</h2>
  
    <h3>Cyberbullying:</h3>
    <p>The internet, whether through via social media, email or text messages, can be used to bully or harass other people (DMahbub, 2023). </p>

    <h3>Addictive:</h3>
    <p>Some people spend too much time chatting with friends online or browsing social media sites instead of interacting with people face-to-face (DMahbub, 2023).</p>

    <h3>Faster but less memorable learning:</h3>
    <p>While the lightning pace at which technology functions may appear to be a clear advantage, experienced educators are wary of this aspect. Devices and learning apps can function faster than the human brainâ€™s learning rate. Students may gloss over content, missing out texture and depth along the way (Educators, 2022b).</p>

    <h3>Technology can be distracting:</h3>
    <p>Laptops and tablets are bound to distract students in the classroom. This is especially true if the software does not restrict access to apps not associated with classes, quizzes, or other educational activities (Educators, 2022b).</p>

    <h3>Less direct social interaction:</h3>
    <p>Another source of concern is how technology excises social interaction. When students use technology, they have less need to verbally communicate with their teachers and each other. Online teaching and learning excludes face-to-face interaction (Educators, 2022b). </p>
